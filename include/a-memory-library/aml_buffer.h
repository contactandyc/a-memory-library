/*
  The aml_buffer object is much like the C++ string class in that it supports
  a number of easy to use string methods and a buffer acts like a string in
  that a buffer grows as needed to fit the contents of the string.  The object
  is more than a string object in as much as it also equally allows for
  binary data to be appended to or a combination of binary data and strings.
  At it's core, it is simply a buffer that will auto-resize as needed.  The
  pool object is different in that it is used for lots of smaller allocations.
  The buffer generally is used to track "one thing".  That one thing might
  consist of many parts, but they are generally all tracked together in a
  contiguous space.
